# :wrench: The technical details
## Audio
The audio is disconnected from the lighting - it only determines the final length of the composition. The maximum you can produce in the app is 10s but it can be longer when making it custom.

## Metadata
There are the following tags in the ogg file (order irrelevant):
* TITLE
* ALBUM
* AUTHOR
* COMPOSER
* CUSTOM1
* CUSTOM2

The *AUTHOR* and *CUSTOM1* tags contain both *Base64* encoded and then *zlib compressed* data (Best Compression (no preset dictionary) - see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures)).

### TITLE
Contains the title given in the *Glyph Composer*. Weirdly enough the *Glyph Composer* does not use this tag when displaying the name of the composition - the filename is used instead.

### ALBUM
Saves what sound pack was used when the composition was created. Can be changed without any effect on the audio or lights. It does display in the *Glyph Composer*.

### CUSTOM2
This indicates how many [\[Zones\]](./1_Terminology.md#zones) get addressed. This must match with the [*COMPOSER*](#composer) tag.

| Phone                                                                     | *CUSTOM2* string |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------: |
| Nothing Phone (1)                                                         |          `5cols` |
| Nothing Phone (1) - special 15 [\[Zones\]](./1_Terminology.md#zones) mode |          `5cols` |
| Nothing Phone (2)                                                         |         `33cols` |
| Nothing Phone (2a) / Nothing Phone (2a) Plus                              |         `26cols` |

> [!NOTE]
> This tag was not always present before the 1.4.0 *Glyph Composer* update where only the Nothing Phone (1) and Nothing Phone (2) were supported. It was missing if the [\[composition\]](./1_Terminology.md#compositioncompositions) was made on the Nothing Phone (1). Otherwise it had the Nothing Phone (2) value.

### AUTHOR
After decoding and decompressing it contains the [\[Glyph\]](./1_Terminology.md#glyphs) light data in a csv like manner where in each line we have the [\[Zones\]](./1_Terminology.md#zones) separated and followed by a comma (`,`). Each line corresponds to 16.666ms (60Hz).

Depending on the phone we have n Zones:
| Phone                                                                     |   n |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --: |
| Nothing Phone (1)                                                         |   5 |
| Nothing Phone (1) - special 15 [\[Zones\]](./1_Terminology.md#zones) mode |  15 |
| Nothing Phone (2)                                                         |  33 |
| Nothing Phone (2a) / Nothing Phone (2a) Plus                              |  26 |

> [!NOTE]
> The Nothing Phone (1) is a bit of a special case:  
> It officially only supports addressing the 5 [\[Glyphs\]](./1_Terminology.md#glyphs) with no way to address the 4 [\[Zones\]](./1_Terminology.md#zones) in the *Battery* [\[Glyph\]](./1_Terminology.md#glyphs) and the 8 in the *USB Line* [\[Glyph\]](./1_Terminology.md#glyphs) with the normal functionality of the *Glyph Composer* app.
>
> Because the *Glyph Composer* uses essentially the *Glyph Developer Kit* in the backend we can increase the [\[Zone\]](./1_Terminology.md#zones) count from 5 to 15 to account for all the extra [\[Zones\]](./1_Terminology.md#zones) mentioned.
>
> Why not always use the 15 [\[Zones\]](./1_Terminology.md#zones) mode on the Phone (1)?:  
> Because it is not officially supported, the lights get stuck if the [\[composition\]](../1_Terminology.md#compositioncompositions) stops prematurely. Toggle the *Glyph Torch* to fix it.
>
> If we use the 15 [\[Zones\]](./1_Terminology.md#zones) mode on the Phone (1) we still need to set the [*CUSTOM2*](#custom2) tag to `5cols` or else it won't import. This makes it a bit tricky to discern 5 [\[Zones\]](./1_Terminology.md#zones) and 15 [\[Zones\]](./1_Terminology.md#zones) [\[compositions\]](./1_Terminology.md#compositioncompositions).

#### Indexes for the [\[Glyphs\]](./1_Terminology.md#glyphs)
Depending on the phone we have different indexes in the csv for the [\[Glyphs\]](./1_Terminology.md#glyphs):
##### Nothing Phone (1) indexes
| Index | Glyph    |
| ----: | :------- |
|     0 | Camera   |
|     1 | Diagonal |
|     2 | Battery  |

| 25-32 | USB Line                             | From bottom to top |

##### Nothing Phone (2a) / Nothing Phone (2a) Plus indexes
| Index | Glyph/Zone   | Direction                     |
| ----: | :----------- | :---------------------------- |
|  0-23 | Top left     | From bottom left to top right |
|    24 | Middle right | -                             |
|    25 | Bottom left  | -                             |

Each [\[Zone\]](./1_Terminology.md#zones) can have a light value from 0 to 4095 (2^12 values), the smallest step is 1. If the data is longer than the audio it will not be played.

The new line consists of Carriage Return (CR) and Line Feed (LF): `\r\n`
The data ends with a final new line `\r\n`.

*Example Nothing Phone (1):*
```csv
0,0,4095,0,0,
0,0,4095,0,2032,
0,0,0,0,0,
0,0,0,0,0,
0,0,0,0,0,

```
The *Battery* [\[Glyph\]](./1_Terminology.md#glyphs) is fully on for ~33.332ms and the *USB Dot* [\[Glyph\]](./1_Terminology.md#glyphs) is only on for 16.666ms after 16.666ms (after the start) at about 50% brightness.

*Example Nothing Phone (1) - 15 [\[Zone\]](./1_Terminology.md#zones) mode:*
```csv
0,0,4095,4095,4095,4095,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
0,0,4095,4095,4095,4095,2032,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,

```
Same example as above but with the special 5 [\[Zone\]](./1_Terminology.md#zones) mode on Phone (1).

A loading bar like animation in the *Top left* [\[Glyph\]](./1_Terminology.md#glyphs), while the *Middle right* and the *Bottom left* [\[Glyph\]](./1_Terminology.md#glyphs) alternate, starting with the *Middle right*.

### COMPOSER
This depends on what device the composition was created on:
| Phone                                                                     |             *Composer* string |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| Nothing Phone (1)                                                         |  `v1-Spacewar Glyph Composer` |
| Nothing Phone (1) - special 15 [\[Zones\]](./1_Terminology.md#zones) mode |  `v1-Spacewar Glyph Composer` |
| Nothing Phone (2)                                                         |      `v1-Pong Glyph Composer` |
| Nothing Phone (2a)                                                        |    `v1-Pacman Glyph Composer` |
| Nothing Phone (2a) Plus                                                   | `v1-PacmanPro Glyph Composer` |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before the 1.4.0 *Glyph Composer* update the prefix `v1-` was missing and only the Nothing Phone (1) and the Nothing Phone (2) were supported.

> [!NOTE]
> The *Composer* string gets constructed with a Java *StringBuilder*:
> 1. Appending "v1-"
> 2. Appending the result of the Android `Build.DEVICE` field. (gets the `ro.product.device` property)
> 3. Appending " Glyph Composer" - yes, with the space infront

If the tag does not have the right form or not match with the device or if the [*CUSTOM2*](#custom2) tag does not correlate (e.g.: `33cols` for a Nothing Phone (1) would NOT correlate), the *Glyph Composer* will not import the file.

### CUSTOM1
This is mainly data for the *Glyph Composer* so it can display dots on the timeline when playing the file. After decoding and decompressing each dot in the app is defined by a timestamp (in ms and 1 ms steps) and an ID representing which of the 5 buttons in the app has been pressed. On most devices this ID can be correlated to a [\[Glyph\]](./1_Terminology.md#glyphs). The timestamp and the ID are separated by a dash (`-`). Between each dot is a comma (`,`) and at the end of the line also.

There are no new lines in this file, all dots are after one another.
It is entirely possible to mismatch the *CUSTOM1* and *ALBUM* data.

> [!NOTE]
> Keep in mind that the *Glyph Composer* only has 5 buttons (therefore 5 dot locations) which means that complex custom light animations which address Zones individually can not be properly displayed in the *Glyph Composer*.

##### Nothing Phone (2a) / Nothing Phone (2a) Plus indexes
| Glyph/Zone   |  ID |
| :----------- | --: |
| Top left     |   0 |
| Middle right |   1 |
| Bottom left  |   2 |

> [!NOTE]
> Assigning every [\[Glyph\]](./1_Terminology.md#glyphs) an ID on the Nothing Phone (2a) / Nothing Phone (2a) Plus is not possible because it only has three of them. I've just choosen these IDs.

## Aditional Notes
A [\[composition\]](./1_Terminology.md#compositioncompositions) *can* be manually imported by moving the audio file to `Ringtones/Compositions`. The phone will interpret the lighting data in it's own way if it was made for another phone.

A Nothing Phone (1) [\[composition\]](./1_Terminology.md#compositioncompositions) can be played back on a Nothing Phone (2) if it does **NOT** use 15 [\[Zones\]](./1_Terminology.md#zones).

A Nothing Phone (2a) [\[composition\]](./1_Terminology.md#compositioncompositions) can be played back on a Nothing Phone (2a) Plus and vice versa. They both have the same Glyph and Zone layout. The only difference is the [*COMPOSER*](#composer) tag.
