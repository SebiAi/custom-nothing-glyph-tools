## Final steps
You did it! You made your first composition :partying_face::tada:

This last chapter will cover the following:
* How to safely transfer your [\[composition\]](../1_Terminology.md#compositioncompositions) to your device
* How to import your masterpiece on your phone
* How you can share your creation without infringing on copyright laws
* What to do next

### Transfer your [\[composition\]](../1_Terminology.md#compositioncompositions) safely
I recommend the following methods:
* Cable connection with your PC
* Signal/WhatsApp

> [!CAUTION]
> There are some known services which might change the audio file extension, metadata or audio codec. These include but are not limited to:
> * Google Drive

***

### Import your masterpiece
1. Open the *Glyph Composer* or install it from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nothing.glyph.composer).
2. Press the hamburger button in the top left
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the button is grayed out, record and save a simple [\[composition\]](../1_Terminology.md#compositioncompositions) in the *Glyph Composer* app.
3. Click on the three dots in the top right corner and **select *Import***.
4. Choose your [\[composition\]](../1_Terminology.md#compositioncompositions) with the stock Android file manager
> [!CAUTION]
> Do not use any other third party file explorer! More info [here](../6_Troubleshooting.md#file-is-not-created-by-composer).

> [!NOTE]
> If your composition does not import and you get a small popup at the bottom of your screen, see the [Troubleshooting](../6_Troubleshooting.md) topic.

### Share your creation
> [!CAUTION]
> **Do NOT share your [\[composition\]](../1_Terminology.md#compositioncompositions) if you do not have the rights to distribute the audio! This can result in legal complications!**

If you want to share your creation share your [\[NGlyph File\]](../1_Terminology.md#nglyph-file) with the following information:
```
Song Name: <Song Name you used>
Artist(s): <Artists which are in this music>
Link: <YouTube or direct download link (Internet Archive)>
From: <The starting timestamp - see Audacity, e.g.: 00h01m21.041s>
To: <The end timestamp - see Audacity, e.g.: 00h03m45.123s>
```

With the file and this info it is possible to recreate it.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a channel in the Discord where you can share your [\[composition\]](../1_Terminology.md#compositioncompositions) (link at the [root of the wiki](../README.md#need-help)).

***

### What to do next
If you want to step up your game and create even better [\[compositions\]](../1_Terminology.md#compositioncompositions) you can work through the [Create Advanced compositions (Zones)](../5_Create%20Advanced%20compositions%20(Zones).md) topic.

If you are more interrested in the technical aspect of how this all works, check out the [Technical Details](../8_Technical%20Details.md) topic.
