# [\[glyphId\]](../1_Terminology.md#glyphid) Nothing Phone (1)

> [!CAUTION]
> There is a specific destinction between [\[compositions\]](../1_Terminology.md#compositioncompositions) that use [\[Zones\]](../1_Terminology.md#zones) vs. ones that don't:
> * **5 Zones:** Uses the full [\[Glyphs\]](../1_Terminology.md#glyphs) only. Is upwards compatible with the Nothing Phone (2).
> * **15 Zones (Advanced):** Uses at least **one** [\[Zone\]](../1_Terminology.md#zones). Can **only** be used on a Nothing Phone (1) ~~and the lights get stuck if the [\[composition\]](../1_Terminology.md#compositioncompositions) stops prematurely. Toggle the *Glyph Torch* to fix it~~. This issue was fixed with `Nothing OS V3.2-250610-1104` and higher on the Phone (1).
