# Welcome to the documentation of the Glyph Tools!

## Stylistic conventions
First lets start with an explanation of what the stylistic conventions in the wiki imply:
* Words encased in square brackets can be clicked to jump to the words definition/meaning. *Example:* [\[compositions\]](./1_Terminology.md#compositioncompositions)
* Italics are used to
  * *emphasise* sections
  * signal in a step by step instruction that this text can be found one to one on an interactable element in an application. Mind the context.
* Inline code blocks like `this` are used to signal that you might want to copy the text to paste somewhere else. Mind the context.

## Are you new here?
I would recommend working through each topic **in order**, starting with "*Downloading the Glyph Tools*" and ending with "*Create Advanced compositions (Zones)*".  
The other chapters are here for the curious minds :wink:
